Hot off the press: libGDX 1.13.1 brings a few pressing bugfixes as well as a couple of interesting new features. Check out the full list below to find out more.

## A few notable changes

- [ANDROID] The AndroidX core dependency is now included with libGDX ([#7543](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7543)).
- [CORE] There have been quite a few improvements to the tiled map support ([#7076](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7076), [#7135](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7135), [#7505](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7505), [#7534](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7534)). Thanks to BoBIsHere86 for that!
- [GWT] Fix issue with SpriteBatch ([#7486](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7486))
- [iOS] Updated to [MobiVM 2.3.22](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/wiki/Changelog#current-master-2322----work-in-progress) from 2.3.21.
- [LWJGL3] We downgraded the LWJGL version to 3.3.3 to avoid the ongoing antivirus false positives. This means that the RISC-V support is only available in libGDX 1.13.1 if you manually upgrade your LWJGL dependency ([#7555](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7555)).

To check out our progress towards the next release, take a look at the [corresponding milestone](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/milestone/8) on GitHub. As always, we appreciate feedback on the issues/PRs already part of the milestone and would like to invite you to bring forward anything still missing on our [Discord](/community/discord/) server!
