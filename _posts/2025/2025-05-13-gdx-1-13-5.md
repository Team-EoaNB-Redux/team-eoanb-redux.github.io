Hi, kids, Mario here! After accidentally breaking a few patch releases (oops!), I'm back with libGDX 1.13.5! The reason? Sonatype is [sunsetting OSSRH in June](https://central.sonatype.org/news/20250326_ossrh_sunset/), forcing us to migrate to their new Central Portal service. With their lacking documentation and Gradle support, it was quite the adventure. But we got there in the end!

Please note that due to an issue with R8 and the Supplier API (which is used within the pooling classes), libGDX 1.13.5 is not recommended for Android. Users are advised to switch to the new 1.14.0 or stay on version 1.13.1. 
{: .notice--warning}

## A few notable changes

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Android: Updated minSDK to 21. Multidex config is no longer required.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Gradle: Snapshot builds are now published to https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/. This means that you need to update your build scripts and add the new repository URL. Some of your other snapshot dependencies might still live on OSSRH, so make sure to keep that repository as well.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Skin `setEnabled` now only works with actors that implement `Styleable`. Use `setEnabledReflection` for old behavior.
- [iOS] Updated to MobiVM 2.3.23 and replaced MetalANGLE backend with MetalANGLEKit.
- [ANDROID] Removed `AndroidApplicationConfiguration#touchSleepTime`.
- [LWJGL3] The signature of `OpenALLwjgl3Audio#registerSound/registerMusic` has changed to use method references.
- Added support for Tiled "Text Objects" through new TextMapObject class.
- Multiple API additions including various Array replacement methods and new Drawable default interface methods.
- API Deprecation: Deprecated ReflectionPool and related methods in favor of new DefaultPool with improved safety.

To check out our progress towards the next release, take a look at the [corresponding milestone](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/milestone/9) on GitHub. As always, we appreciate feedback on the issues/PRs already part of the milestone and would like to invite you to bring forward anything still missing on our [Discord](/community/discord/) server!
