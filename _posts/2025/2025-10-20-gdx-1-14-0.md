EoaNBR v3.2.0 has been released with bug fixes and new features. See the changelog below for a complete overview.

## A few notable changes

- [CORE] The `Pools` changes in 1.13.5 have been partially reverted and the class has been deprecated. Users should either create a `DefaultPool` themselves or switch to the new `PoolManager`. To avoid reflection, `PoolManager` requires registering a class beforehand either via the constructor or `#addPool`. See [#7648](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7648) for more information of the (now deprecated) `Pools` class and [#7678](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7678) for more information on `PoolManager`.
- [CORE] Once again there have been multiple big and small improvements to the tiled map support, in particular class and template object support as well as the addition of a universal tiled map loader. Special thanks to BoBIsHere86 for that!
- [CORE] `JsonValue#get` is no longer case insensitive. Use `JsonValue#getIgnoreCase()`.
- [CORE] `StringBuilder` has been removed and its methods merged with `CharArray`.
- [LWJGL3] You can now use `Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration.useGlfwAsync();` as a shorthand for `if (SharedLibraryLoader.os == Os.MacOsX) Configuration.GLFW_LIBRARY_NAME.set("glfw_async");`

To check out our progress towards the next release, take a look at the [corresponding milestone](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/milestone/10) on GitHub. As always, we appreciate feedback on the issues/PRs already part of the milestone and would like to invite you to bring forward anything still missing on our [Discord](/community/discord/) server!

```
- [BREAKING CHANGE] API: Pools changes in 1.13.5 have been partially reverted. Pools#get/Pools#obtain method return to requiring a Class parameter. Reflection is avoided by using pre-populated Pools for libgdx classes. See https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7648 and https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7678
- [BREAKING CHANGE] `JsonSkimmer` API changed to use JsonToken parameters.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] `JsonValue#last` added for O(1) append. Code that changes next may also need to change last.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] `JsonValue#get` is no longer case insensitive. Use `JsonValue#getIgnoreCase()`.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] `StringBuilder` has been deleted; its methods have been merged with `CharArray`.
- API Addition: Added `JsonValue#toJson` that takes a Writer.
- API Addition: Added `getProgrammaticChangeEvents()` to scene2d.ui actors that have `setProgrammaticChangeEvents()`.
- API Addition: Added `JsonMatcher`, extracts values with pattern matching.
- API Addition: Added `setUniform_iv` functions in `ShaderProgram` to set uniform integer arrays
- API Deprecation: Pools class is now deprecated and not used internally. Some functionality can be restored by using the new `PoolManager` class.
